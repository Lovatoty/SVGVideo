## SVGVideo
This overly ambitious project is for SVG based video format. This project is meant to add the dimension of time to SVGs to form a video. The SVG standard does support animations, but they are currently not being used.

##Goals
#Import video for "Upscaling"
One goal of this project is to "upscale" animated videos my converting them to SVG and rendering them at a higher resolution. This can already be done on a framee-by-frame basis. Other technologies involving ML can do this as well.

#Higher Frame Rates
By vectorizing the dimension of time, we can natively render a video at any framerate. 

##Issues & Limitations
#Tooling for existing animation software.

#Rendering Natively vs Encoding to a common video file type.
